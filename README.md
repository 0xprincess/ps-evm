## ps-evm: High-performance Ethereum Virtual Machine in Modern PowerShell

**ps-evm** is an open-source project implementing the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) in modern PowerShell. It contributes to the diversity of Ethereum client software, a critical factor in the long-term health and security of the Ethereum network.

### Why Client Diversity Matters

The Ethereum roadmap emphasizes decentralization and security. A diverse ecosystem of client software implementations fosters both. 

* **Reduced Attack Surface:** Multiple client implementations with different codebases reduces the risk of a single vulnerability impacting the entire network.
* **Innovation and Experimentation:** Diverse clients encourage innovation and experimentation with different approaches to running Ethereum nodes. 
* **Increased Fault Tolerance:** A wider range of client software makes the network more resilient to bugs or failures within any single implementation.

### ps-evm and Client Diversity

ps-evm joins established clients written in languages like Go, C++, and Python. By leveraging the power and familiarity of PowerShell, it opens the door to a new developer community for contributing to the Ethereum ecosystem.
